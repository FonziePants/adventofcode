# [Day 9: Encoding Error](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/9)

I'm not a huge fan of these kinds of problems because there's always a pretty straightforward approach involving looping through collections, carefully choosing iterators, and performing simple equality checks. It's not that I mind when problems are easy, but I don't like that the most frustrating parts of these problems are typically minor errors in choosing iterators and indices. I'd rather work on problems that involve thoughtful data representation and interesting data manipulation and mutation.

This problem might be more interesting if the challenge was making it performant -- avoiding nested loops, etc, but Advent of Code incentivizes speed over performance, so that's the direction I've been taking.

## Part 1
>Here is a larger example which only considers the previous 5 numbers (and has a preamble of length 5):
>```
>35
>20
>15
>25
>47
>40
>62
>55
>65
>95
>102
>117
>150
>182
>127
>219
>299
>277
>309
>576
>```
>In this example, after the 5-number preamble, almost every number is the sum of two of the previous 5 numbers; the only number that does not follow this rule is 127.
>
>The first step of attacking the weakness in the XMAS data is to find the first number in the list (after the preamble) which is not the sum of two of the 25 numbers before it. What is the first number that does not have this property?

The only real snafu I ran into here was when I forgot to cast the lines I was reading into my array as `int` and so my arithmetic clearly didn't work as planned. Luckily, that was a quick and obvious fix (because by no means should `35` + `20` have a value of `3525`).

My approach was really simple:
- Loop through the array starting after the preamble
- For each number, try adding all possible combinations of 2 entries together
- If you find a valid pair, flip the `valid` flag, abort from the inner loop, and move onto the next number to check

```
def find_first_invalid_number(full_num_array, preamble):
    if len(full_num_array) < preamble:
        return None
    
    for i in range(preamble,len(full_num_array)):
        num = full_num_array[i]

        valid = False
        for j in range(i-preamble,i):
            for k in range(j+1,i):
                prev1 = full_num_array[j]
                prev2 = full_num_array[k]

                if num == (prev1 + prev2):
                    valid = True
                    break
            if valid:
                break
        
        if not valid:
            print("Number {0} at index {1} is NOT valid. Stop processing.".format(num, i))
            return i #index of num
```

## Part 2
>--- Part Two ---
>
>The final step in breaking the XMAS encryption relies on the invalid number you just found: you must find a contiguous set of at least two numbers in your list which sum to the invalid number from step 1.

>20
>15
>25
>47
>40
>62
>55
>65
>95
>102
>117
>150
>182
>127
>219
>299
>277
>309
>576
>```
>In this list, adding up all of the numbers from 15 through 40 produces the invalid number from step 1, 127. (Of course, the contiguous set of numbers in your actual list might be much longer.)

>To find the encryption weakness, add together the smallest and largest number in this contiguous range; in this example, these are 15 and 47, producing 62.

For this, I just brute-forced it. I took the subset of the num array between its start and the first invalid number...
```
def find_contiguous_set_of_addends(full_num_array,index_of_num,debug=False):
    num_array_subset = full_num_array[:index_of_num]
    sum_target = full_num_array[index_of_num]
```
...and I iterated through every possible contiguous sum within that range. There were probably heuristics I could have applied to the range I was looking at to avoid some checks, but because Advent of Code incentivizes speed over performance (and because I wanted to beat my spouse today), I didn't bother with those kinds of optimizations.
```
    # iterate through all the possible starting numbers
    for start in range(len(num_array_subset)):

        # iterate through all the possible sequence lengths
        for stop in range(start+1,len(num_array_subset)):

            sum = 0
            highest_num = 0
            lowest_num = sum_target * 10000
            for i in range(start,stop+1): #stop+1 makes it inclusive
                num = num_array_subset[i]
                sum += num

                if num > highest_num:
                    highest_num = num
                
                if num < lowest_num:
                    lowest_num = num
            
            if debug:
                print("Sum of values between index {0} (value = {1}) and index {2} (value = {3}) is {4}.".format(start,num_array_subset[start],stop,num_array_subset[stop],sum))
            
            if sum == sum_target:
                encryption_weakness = highest_num + lowest_num
                print("Sequence found! Terminate program. Encryption weakness = {0}".format(encryption_weakness))
                return encryption_weakness
```

The debug print took awhile to run (over a minute ðŸ˜…), but if I toggled that off, I got the answer in a matter of seconds.
